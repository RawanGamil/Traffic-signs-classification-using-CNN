# Traffic-signs-classification-using-CNN

Autonomous driving cars are becoming popular everywhere and the need for a robust traffic sign recognition system that ensures safety by recognizing traffic signs accurately and fast is increasing.

The aim of the project is to build an image classifier that can recognize the different images of road traffic signs. 
We built a CNN model that can classify 43 different traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition dataset. The dataset is made up of 39 209 images for training and 12 630 for testing.
